# Quantum-Random-Number-Generator
A Quantum Random Number Generator implemented using Qiskit
# Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) ⚛️

A Quantum Random Number Generator implemented using **Qiskit** and a quantum simulator.
This project demonstrates how **quantum superposition and measurement** can be used to generate **true random numbers**, unlike classical pseudo-random generators.

---

## 🔹 Project Objective
To design and implement a QRNG using quantum principles and analyze the randomness of generated bits.

---

## 🔹 Technologies Used
- Python
- Qiskit
- Quantum Simulator (Aer)
- Google Colab

---

## 🔹 Quantum Circuit
![Quantum Circuit](circuit.png)

The Hadamard gate places the qubit in superposition, and measurement collapses it to a random state.

---

## 🔹 Randomness Distribution
![Histogram](histogram.png)

The histogram shows an approximately uniform distribution of 0s and 1s, validating quantum randomness.

---

## 🔹 Applications
- Cryptography
- Secure key generation
- Quantum security systems
- Monte Carlo simulations

---

## 🔹 Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates true randomness generated through quantum measurement, highlighting the advantages of quantum systems over classical random number generators.
